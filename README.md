## Introduction

 Market Basket Analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior and can guide business decisions, such as product placement and targeted promotions. In this project, we use R to analyze the Groceries dataset, which contains transactional data of items purchased by customers. The goal is to uncover associations between items to understand purchasing patterns.

## Dataset

 The Groceries dataset contains transactional data from a grocery store, where each row represents a customer's purchase. The dataset includes a list of items bought in each transaction, making it suitable for Market Basket Analysis. You can access the dataset directly from R package using 'data(Groceries)' command.
